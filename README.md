# macMouseFix
Describes software installs that will fix mac's terrible mouse bugs

## Software
### [Smooze](https://smooze.co/)
#### Free trial:
* Reverse vertical direction - *Mac still has no setting for mouse vs trackpad direction*
* Vertical lines - *Mac has no built in option, and default appears to be 1 line per scroll. I change this to 3 in line with Windows default.*
* Horizontal lines
#### $5 paid:
* Unlocks 4 tabs of customization.
* Auto scroll / Middle click scroll - *Enables it to an OK level. Different apps have different behavior, but Mac fails to enable this without software. I like this for Chrome.*
### [Discrete Scroll](https://github.com/emreyolcu/discrete-scroll)
Free software:
* Mouse acceleration - *Mac seems to have no option to disable this. Middle scrolling once will sometimes not scroll, and scroll amount requires middle mouse acceleration. Extremely undesireable behvior.*
